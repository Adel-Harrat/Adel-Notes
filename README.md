# Adel-Notes: A Note-Taking App

Hello! Welcome to Adel-Notes, a project I developed to deepen my skills in Svelte and SvelteKit through hands-on practice. This app is designed to be a simple, functional, and visually pleasing note-taking experience.

## Challenges & Solutions

My main focus was on making the app as fast and efficient as possible while maintaining clean, modular code. I spent a lot of time optimizing the site to improve performance and responsiveness on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Key Takeaways

One of the most valuable lessons from this project was the importance of reusable components. By creating versatile components, I made the app more adaptable to future changesâ€”a practice I plan to carry into future projects.

## A Few Things to Note

- You can sign in with a temporary email if you donâ€™t want to use a personal one (services like TempMail work great for this).
- For demo purposes, note-taking is limited: you can create a maximum of 10 notes or labels. If youâ€™re interested in expanding this limit, feel free to fork the GitHub repo, deploy it on Vercel, and adjust the limit by modifying the condition in `+page.server.ts` (line 50) and in `labels/+page.server.ts` (line 36).
